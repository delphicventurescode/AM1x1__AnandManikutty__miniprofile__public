# La Gravaj Teorioj  
*A Portfolio of Original Theoretical Frameworks*

**La Gravaj Teorioj** (“The Important Theories”) is a collection of original theoretical frameworks I have developed across political science, philosophy, economics, and historical anthropology. Each theory is designed to challenge long-standing assumptions in its respective field and offer a fresh, modern alternative.

While these theories span different domains, they share a common purpose:  
to bring clarity, depth, and new explanatory power to questions that have shaped human history, governance, culture, and value creation.

This document provides an overview of the project and links to each individual theory.

# Purpose of La Gravaj Teorioj

The goal of La Gravaj Teorioj is to rethink foundational ideas that influence how we understand the world. Across disciplines, many dominant theories are rooted in assumptions developed decades—or centuries—ago. They often fail to account for:

- cognitive and behavioral dimensions of human decision-making  
- technological acceleration and modern complexity  
- new forms of identity, interaction, and global interdependence  
- evidence emerging from anthropology, data science, and networked systems  

La Gravaj Teorioj proposes updated frameworks that reflect contemporary realities while remaining philosophically rigorous and empirically grounded.

# The Four Core Theories

## 1. A New Political Science Theory  
**Rival to:** Samuel Huntington and Karl Marx  
This theory reinterprets global conflict, identity, and geopolitical behavior through a model that moves beyond civilizational determinism and economic reductionism.  
It offers a more dynamic, human-centered explanation of how political forces evolve.

## 2. La Gxoja Filozofio (A New Philosophy)  
**Rival to:** Classical & modern philosophical traditions  
This philosophy centers **joy as a responsibility**, not a by-product.  
It integrates emotional clarity, compassion, cognitive science, and quiet strength to propose a new way of living and understanding human experience.

## 3. A New Theory of the Firm  
**Rival to:** Ronald Coase and Oliver Williamson  
This framework expands the concept of the firm beyond transaction costs and hierarchical governance.

## 4. A New Theory on the Population of the Americas  
**Rival to:** Jared Diamond  
This theory challenges traditional narratives about migration and early settlement patterns in the Americas.  
It proposes a more nuanced, multidisciplinary model incorporating genetics, anthropology, cognition, and bidirectional migration possibilities.

# Unifying Themes Across the Theories

Although each theory addresses its own domain, several core themes run through La Gravaj Teorioj:

- **Human behaviors matter as much as structures**  
- **Identity and meaning shape decisions as much as incentives**  
- **Joy, purpose, and emotional clarity influence large-scale systems**  
- **Complexity requires multidimensional frameworks**  
- **Modern evidence challenges old narratives**  
- **Soft strengths (attention, compassion, resilience) have hard consequences**

These ideas reflect a shift toward understanding systems—political, economic, social—not as rigid mechanisms but as **living, adaptive networks** shaped by human cognition and collective purpose.
