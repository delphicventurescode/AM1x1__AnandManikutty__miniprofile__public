# Theory of the Firm

This section presents an overview of a **new Theory of the Firm** that I have developed — a modern rethinking of how businesses create, organize, and sustain value. The theory challenges several long-standing assumptions in economics and strategic management by offering a more human-centered, dynamic, and systems-oriented perspective.

The work positions itself as an alternative to classic frameworks such as:

- **Ronald Coase’s** transaction-cost theory of the firm  
- **Oliver Williamson’s** work on organizational economics and governance



The goal of the theory is to explain not just *why firms exist*, but *how they evolve*, and *why they behave the way they do*.

A full manuscript detailing the theory is available upon request.
