# Theory on the Population of the Americas

This section outlines a new theory I have developed on the early population of the Americas — a framework that challenges conventional narratives about migration, settlement, and cultural development in the Western hemisphere. This theory is informally sometimes called the GGSP theory (for more on this, see below).

The prevailing explanations for how the Americas were populated often rely on narrow models, most notably those popularized by authors such as:

- **Jared Diamond**, particularly in works that link geographic determinism to patterns of human development.

While these perspectives offer valuable insights, they leave several questions unresolved and rely on assumptions that no longer align with emerging evidence across genetics, anthropology, linguistics, and environmental history.

This new theory proposes an alternative viewpoint that seeks to:

- Re-examine long-held assumptions about migration timelines  
- Consider multi-directional patterns of movement rather than a single pathway  
- Incorporate cultural and cognitive factors often omitted from traditional models  
- Explore overlooked or underestimated influences on settlement patterns  
- Provide a more holistic understanding of how early peoples adapted, traveled, and formed complex societies  

The aim is not merely to revise existing explanations, but to **offer a broader, more flexible framework** that brings together insights from multiple disciplines and challenges the limitations of geographic determinism.

Once we say that the Population of the Americas was facilitated not just by Guns, Germs and Steel but also by Philosophy (so, this theory is informally called the Guns. Germs, Steel and Philosophy theory), you start seeing the history of the world itself quite differently.
