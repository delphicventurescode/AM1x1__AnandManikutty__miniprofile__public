# SUMMARY

This GitHub repository was created to reflect my **restructured professional profile** — integrating my work across technology, analytics, teaching, research, and theory-building. 

This directory has my researcher-profile.

~

I am a driven, interdisciplinary professional with over 10 years of experience in **digital analytics**, **data-driven decision-making**, and **digital transformation** across Technology, Media, and Agribusiness. My work brings together computational thinking, data modeling, and strategic insight to unlock business value and fuel innovation.

Alongside my industry and academic background, I have been developing a series of ambitious theoretical projects across **philosophy**, **political science**, **economics**, and **business strategy**. These belong to a broader body of work I call **La Gravaj Teorioj** (“The Important Theories”).

# LA GRAVAJ TEORIAJ PROJEKTOJ

Under the umbrella of **La Gravaj Teorioj**, I have developed several original theories, each designed as a substantive intellectual contribution within its discipline:

### **• A New Political Science Theory**
A re-examination of global political dynamics, positioned as a counterpoint to ideas from Samuel Huntington and Karl Marx.

### **• A New Philosophy**
A fresh conceptual framework on human experience and knowledge, engaging with traditions from Socrates and Aristotle to Sartre and Camus.

### **• A Theory on the Population of the Americas**
A challenge to traditional migration and settlement narratives; a response to arguments popularized by Jared Diamond.

### **• A New Theory of the Firm**
A reconceptualization of how businesses create and sustain value, offering alternatives to frameworks by Coase and Williamson.

Many of these projects are in various stages of the publication process.  

Additional details — including excerpts, diagrams, and conceptual notes — are available through QR codes.

# 📖 Featured Work: *A Novelette of Political Theory*

My latest publication is a visually rich, narrative-driven novelette set in the Middle East. It introduces the political theory outlined above through character and atmosphere rather than academic exposition.

This work blends literary fiction with rigorous conceptual depth — allowing ideas to emerge through story rather than lecture.
