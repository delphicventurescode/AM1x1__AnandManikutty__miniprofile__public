# Political Theory

This theory is part of what we internally call the LGPT document (or documents, as now there is more than just one book). LPGT stands for La Grava Politika Teorio.

The LGPT documents outline a new political theory I have developed — a framework designed to re-examine how nations, cultures, and systems in the Middle East interact in the 21st century. It is intended as both a critique of, and a successor to, some of the most influential traditions in modern political thought.

In particular, the theory responds directly to:

- **Samuel Huntington’s** *Clash of Civilizations*  
- **Karl Marx’s** theories of class, conflict, and historical progression

Rather than interpreting global dynamics through civilizational conflict or economic determinism, this new theory offers a more nuanced, flexible, and human-centered model for understanding change, identity, and power and how these have shaped the dynamics of the Middle East.
