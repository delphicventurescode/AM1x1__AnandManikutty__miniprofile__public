I currently teach as Faculty at PES University. Subjects I teach or have taught include Data, Analytics, AI, and Behavioral Science. I publish books and develop new theoretical frameworks across political science, economics, and philosophy. This academic depth strengthens my ability to communicate clearly, think systemically, and solve complex problems across domains.
